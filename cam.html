				<p>Please be informed that the deadline for submitting the camera-ready paper is 11 January, 2023. The
					deadlines are hard deadlines and cannot be extended, i.e., <span style="color: red">a
						late submission will not be considered for the inclusion into the proceedings.</span></p>

				<p><b>Please comply with the following steps carefully in preparation for your camera-ready paper.</b>
				</p>

				<div class="oline"></div>

				<div class="title">Step 1</div>

				<p>Authors should consult Springer's <a
						href="ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/svproc/guidelines/Springer_Instructions_for_Authors_of_Proceedings_CS.pdf">authors'
						instructions</a>.</p>
				<p>
					Format your paper according to the LNCS template and generate the corresponding PDF file of your
					manuscript. Refer to Springer's "<a
						href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">Information
						for Authors of Computers Science Proceedings</a>" page,
					where the correct templates for the preparation of papers can be downloaded. Springer’s LaTeX
					templates are also available in <a
						href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WsdHOy5uZpg">Overleaf</a>
					(Or for <a href="ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/llncs2e.zip">LaTeX</a> or for <a
						href="ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/word/splnproc1703.zip">Word</a>).
					Springer aims to publish all
					proceedings papers in full-text XML. Templates for LaTeX are based on CMR, and the xml templates for
					Word are based on Times. Authors should select the font in accordance with the template used for
					their papers. Papers using other fonts will be converted by Springer’s typesetters.
				</p>
				<p>
					A mixture of LaTeX and Word files is fine. Please do not send any older versions of papers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Springer encourages authors to include their <a
						href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/orcid-for-your-proceedings-paper/12272740">ORCIDs</a>
					in their papers. Springer applies and encourages
					all contributing authors to also apply for an individual ORCID at www.orcid.org and include them
					with your address information. Springer encourages the inclusion of all of the authors’ email
					addresses and ORCIDs in the header, but at the very least, the email address of the corresponding
					author should be present. The ORCID in number form will be replaced by the ORCID icon, which will
					link from the eBook to the actual ID in the ORCID database. As a result, only the ORCID icon will
					appear in the printed book.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a paper includes an Appendix, it should be placed in front of the references. If it has been
					placed elsewhere, it will be moved by Springer’s typesetters. If there is only one, it is designated
					"Appendix"; if there are more than one, they are designated "Appendix 1," "Appendix 2," etc.
				</p>

				<!-- <p>
					Paper length:
				</p>
				<p>
					Research Paper: The length of Full Paper is limited to 12-15 LNCS pages, including all text,
					figures, references and appendices.
				</p> -->

				<div class="title">Step 2</div>

				<p>Complete the <a href="/files/contact.txt" download="contact.txt">contact.txt</a></p>
				<p>
					You should fill in the surnames of all authors, first names of all authors, contact author’s name
					and mailing address as well as the corresponding author’s email in the contact.txt. Once data
					processing has been finished, Springer shall contact the corresponding authors and ask him/her to
					check his/her final papers.
				</p>

				<div class="oline"></div>

				<div class="title">Step 3</div>
				<p>
					Complete the <a href="/files/Copyright-Form.docx" download="Copyright Form.docx">Copyright form</a>. The corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the
					authors of that paper, must complete and sign the Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author,
					who must match the corresponding author marked on the paper, must have the full right, power, and
					authority to sign the agreement on behalf of all of the authors of a particular paper, and accepts
					responsibility for releasing this material on their behalf. It is possible to have two corresponding
					authors per paper (preferably one, but no more than two). Once a paper has been delivered to
					Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the paper cannot be made. Authors’names cannot be
					added or deleted, their order cannot be changed, and the corresponding author cannot be altered.
					Springer does not accept digital signatures on the consent-to-publish right forms at present. If you
					have any queries regarding copyright, please contact Springer well in advance of publication.
				</p>

				<p>
					Note that (1) we do not accept digital signatures, so please make sure that all forms have been
					signed
					in ink; (2) scan the completed Copyright form in electronic format (in PDF) and rename it to be
					$WORKSHOP$_XXX_cr.pdf where XXX is your paper ID and $WORKSHOP$ stands for the name of your
					corresponding workshop (KGMA, SemiBDMA or DeepLUDA).
				</p>

				<div class="oline"></div>

				<div class="title">Step 4</div>
				<p>
					Create a folder named $WORKSHOP$_XXX, where XXX is your paper ID and $WORKSHOP$ stands for the name
					of your corresponding workshop (KGMA, SemiBDMA or DeepLUDA).
				</p>

				<p>
					Place the following files in the folder $WORKSHOP$_XXX:
				</p>

				<p>
					the folder named source files, which contains all the paper source files. Note that you should
					include all the source files, e.g., if you are using Latex, then you should include LaTeX2e files
					for the text and PS/EPS or PDF/JPG files for all figures, as well as the Final DVI file. We need all
					source files (LaTeX files with all the associated style files, special fonts and eps files, or Word
					or rtf files) and the final pdfs of all of the papers. For papers prepared using LaTeX, authors
					should supply the underlying bib file for the references. Please note that we cannot include
					hyperlinks in references. There should be one set of source files and one pdf file per paper.
				</p>

				<p>
					the PDF file named XXX.pdf, where XXX is your paper ID (from Step 1)
				</p>

				<p>
					the contact.txt file (from Step 2)
				</p>

				<p>
					the <a href="/">Copyright</a> form file named $WORKSHOP$_XXX_cr.pdf where XXX is your paper ID (from Step 3) and
					$WORKSHOP$ stands for the name of your corresponding workshop (KGMA, SemiBDMA or DeepLUDA).
				</p>

				<div class="oline"></div>

				<div class="title">Step 5</div>

				<p>Zip up the folder from Step 4 and name it as $WORKSHOP$_XXX.zip.</p>

				<div class="oline"></div>

				<div class="title">Step 6</div>
				<p>Submit the zip file $WORKSHOP$_XXX.zip (from Step 5) to the your corresponding Workshop Organizers.
				</p>
