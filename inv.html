                            <strong>Abstract: </strong>In the process of digitization of medical services, a large
                            amount of multi-modal data are generated, including text, images, videos etc. These data
                            contain rich knowledge, but they are not well exploited at present. Multi-modal learning
                            associates and fuses information from different modalities, which complements and enhances
                            knowledge, and enables machines to have the ability to understand multi-modal information
                            closer to humans. This talk mainly introduces the main research direction of multi-modal
                            learning - Visual Question Answering (VQA). Users give clinically relevant questions and
                            medical images in the form of natural language, and the VQA system is able to give an
                            accurate and convincing answer. A mature and complete medical VQA system can directly view
                            patient images and answer any questions. However, medical VQA is technically more
                            challenging than VQA in general domains. This talk will specifically share the related
                            research, potential applications and corresponding challenges of medical VQA based on the
                            characteristics of multi-modal data in the medical field.

                            knowledge graph community. He has taken charge of several national AI projects and published
                            more than 100 related papers on top-tier conferences and journals. He developed the first
                            interactive emotional virtual idol in the world. The intelligent assistant he built has
                            answered questions from more than one billion users when they did online shopping. He has
                            also served as deputy directors or chairs for several NGOs like CCF, CIPS and SCS.
